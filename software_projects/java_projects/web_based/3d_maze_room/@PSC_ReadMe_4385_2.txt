Title: G3DMazeRoom
Description: This application was a part of my university assignment to create a room with a table in it. On the table is a 3D maze. The user can walk around the room, then jump onto the table and walk around the maze. This code has the following:
1. Creating a 3D environment.
2. Smooth motion camera movement.
3. Perspective animation to 'jump onto the table'.
4. Dynamically generate a 3D maze based on an array.
5. Collision detection around the room, table and 3D maze.
6. Some basic 3D lighting.
7. Texturing.
The code makes use of Java3D, so please make sure you install that as well or it wont run. This was tested on the OpenGL implementation of Java3D.
There is also a supporting documentation explaining the program and concepts. It is ideal for anyone studying Java3D or simply wants to have some fun ... Enjoy.
Remember, if you're doing a similar assignment at college/university ... be original in your code!
Oh yeah, to run it type:
java G3DMazeRoom
