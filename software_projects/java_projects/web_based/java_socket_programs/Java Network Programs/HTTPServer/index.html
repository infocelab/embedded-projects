      <p>iNet Factory is a robust suite of TCP/IP networking components for the 
        Java platform. The components included in iNet Factory provide all the 
        tools necessary to quickly develop network capable Java applications with 
        minimum coding effort. Included are components for FTP, HTTP, SMTP, POP3, 
        MIME, REXEC, RSH, RLOGIN, Telnet, WHOIS and other frequently used protocols. 
      </p>
      <p>This document describes how to install and use the iNet Factory component 
        suite. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the Java programming 
        language. A basic understanding of networking and various TCP/IP protocols 
        is desirable. </p>

          priorities, the SMTP component allows prioritization of an e-mail message. 
          A message with &quot;highest&quot; priority would potentially give the 
          message higher visibility in a recipients mailbox. </li>
        <li> Header management - Easily define SMTP e-mail header values for submission 
          with a e-mail message. An example might be to set the X-Mailer header 
          typically used to define the client software responsible for generating 
          the mail message.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
