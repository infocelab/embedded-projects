            <H2>Let's Play Chess </H2></CENTER>
            <P>Chess is a game for two players, one with the "White" pieces and 
            one with the "Black" pieces. At the beginning of the game, the 
            pieces are set up as pictured at right. (See diagrams below to 
            identify pieces.) These hints will help you to remember the proper 
            board setup: 
            <DL>
              <DT>
              <DD>1. Opposing Kings and Queens go directly opposite each other. 
              <DT>
              <DD>2. The square in the lower right hand corner is a light one 
              ("light on right"). 
              <DT>
              <DD>3. The White Queen goes on a light square, the Black Queen on 
              a dark square ("Queen on color"). </DD></DL>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=157 alt="chessboard set up" 
            src="images/lets10.jpeg" width=166 
            align=middle></CENTER>White always moves first, and then the players 
            take turns moving. Only one piece may be moved at each turn (except 
            for "castling," a special move that is explained later). The Knight 
            is the only piece that can jump over other pieces. All other pieces 
            move only along unblocked lines. You may not move a piece to a 
            square already occupied by one of your own pieces. But you can 
            capture an enemy piece that stands on a square where one of your 
            pieces can move. Simply remove the enemy piece from the board and 
            put your own piece in its place.

            <CENTER>The Pieces and How They Move</CENTER></H3>
            <P><STRONG>The Queen</STRONG>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=157 alt="possible queen moves" 
            src="images/lets7.jpeg" width=166 
            align=middle></CENTER>The Queen is the most powerful piece. She can 
            move any number of squares in any direction — horizontal, vertical, 
            or diagonal — if her path is not blocked. She can reach any of the 
            squares with dots in this diagram. 
            <P><STRONG>The Rook</STRONG>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=158 alt="possible rook moves" 
            src="images/lets6.jpeg" width=171 
            align=middle></CENTER>The Rook is the next most powerful piece. The 
            Rook can move any number of squares vertically or horizontally if 
            its path is not blocked. 
            <P><STRONG>The Bishop</STRONG>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=155 alt="possible bishop moves" 
            src="images/lets5.jpeg" width=168 
            align=middle></CENTER>The Bishop can move any number of squares 
            diagonally if its path is not blocked. Note that this Bishop starts 
            on a light square and can reach only other light squares. At the 
            beginning of the game, you have one "dark-square" Bishop and one 
            "light-square" Bishop.
            <P><STRONG>The Knight</STRONG>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=159 alt="possible knight moves" 
            src="images/lets4.jpeg" width=168 
            align=middle></CENTER>The Knight's move is special. It hops directly 
            from its old square to its new square. The Knight can jump over 
            other pieces between its old and new squares. Think of the Knight's 
            move as an "L." It moves two squares horizontally or vertically and 
            then makes a right-angle turn for one more square. The Knight always 
            lands on a square opposite in color from its old square.
            <P>
            <P><STRONG>The King</STRONG>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=153 alt="possible king moves" 
            src="images/lets9.jpeg" width=163 
            align=middle></CENTER>The King is the most important piece. When he 
            is trapped, his whole army loses. The King can move one square in 
            any direction — for example, to any of the squares with dots in this 
            diagram. (An exception is castling, which is explained later.) The 
            King may never move into check — that is, onto a square attacked by 
            an opponent's piece. 
            <P><STRONG>The Pawn</STRONG>
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=154 alt="possible pawn moves" 
            src="images/lets8.jpeg" width=163 
            align=middle></CENTER>The pawn moves straight ahead (never 
            backward), but it captures diagonally. It moves one square at a 
            time, but on its first move it has the option of moving forward one 
            or two squares. In the diagram, the squares with dots indicate 
            possible destinations for the pawns. The White pawn is on its 
            original square, so it may move ahead either one or two squares. The 
            Black pawn has already moved, so it may move ahead only one square 
            at a time. The squares on which these pawns may capture are 
            indicated by an X.
            <P>If a pawn advances all the way to the opposite end of the board, 
            it is immediately "promoted" to another piece, usually a Queen. It 
            may not remain a pawn or become a King. Therefore, it is possible 
            for each player to have more than one Queen or more than two Rooks, 
            Bishops, or Knights on the board at the same time. 
            <P>
            <CENTER>
            <H3>Special Moves</H3></CENTER>
            <P><STRONG>Castling</STRONG>
            <P>Each player may "castle" only once during a game and when 
            conditions are met. Castling is a special move that lets a player 
            move two pieces at once — the King and one Rook. In castling, the 
            player moves his King two squares to its left or right toward one of 
            his Rooks. At the same time, the Rook involved goes to the square 
            beside the King and toward the center of the board (see 
            illustrations at left). In order to castle, neither the King nor the 
            Rook involved may have moved before. Also, the King may not castle 
            out of check, into check, or through check. Further, there may not 
            be pieces of either color between the King and the Rook involved in 
            castling.
            <P>Castling is often a very important move because it allows you to 
            place your King in a safe location and also allows the Rook to 
            become more active.
            <P>When the move is legal, each player has the choice of castling 
            Kingside or Queenside or not at all, no matter what the other player 
            chooses to do.
            <P>

            align=middle></CENTER>
            <P><STRONG>En Passant</STRONG>
            <P>This French phrase is used for a special pawn capture. It means 
            "in passing," and it occurs when one player moves a pawn two squares 
            forward to try to avoid capture by the opponent's pawn. The capture 
            is made exactly as if the player had moved the pawn only one square 
            forward.
            <P>
            <CENTER><IMG height=146 alt="en passant" 
            src="images/lets2.jpeg" width=156 
            align=middle></CENTER>In the diagram, the Black pawn moves up two 
            squares to the square with the dot. On its turn the White pawn may 
            capture the Black one on the square marked with the X. If the White 
            player does not exercise this option immediately — before playing 
            some other move — the Black pawn is safe from "en passant" capture 
            for the rest of the game. But new opportunities may arise for each 
            pawn in similar circumstances. 
            <P><STRONG>About Check and Checkmate</STRONG> 
            <P>The main goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent's King. The 
            King is not actually captured and removed from the board like other 
            pieces. But if the King is attacked ("checked") and threatened with 
            capture, it must get out of check immediately. If there is no way to 
            get out of check, the position is a "checkmate," and the side that 
            is checkmated loses.
            <P>You may not move into check. For example, moving into a direct 
            line with your opponent's Rook, when if there are no other pieces 
            between the Rook and your King, is not a legal move. Otherwise, the 
            Rook could "capture" the King, which is not allowed.
            <P>If you are in check, there are three ways of getting out: 
            <DL>
              <DT>
              <DD>1. Capturing the attacking piece; 
              <DT>
              <DD>2. Placing one of your own pieces between the attacker and 
              your King (unless the attacker is a Knight); 
              <DT>
              <DD>3. Moving the King away from the attack. </DD></DL>If a checked 
            player can do none of these, he is checkmated and loses the game.
            <P>If a King is not in check, but that player can make no legal 
            move, the position is called a stalemate and the game is scored as a 
            draw, or tie.
