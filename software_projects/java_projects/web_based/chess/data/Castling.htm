<b><font color="#FF0000">To perform Castling</font></b>
<br>1. drag the King to the block containing the Rook (i.e. drag the king
over the rook) and release the mouse button i.e. drag and drop the king
over the rook.
<br>2. Or drag and drop the rook over the king
<br>3. Either way if Castling is allowed, the king and the rook will perform
castling and
<br>&nbsp;will be placed in the after-castling position. The location where
the king and the rook will be placed will be determined by the program
depending on the castling rule. The player does not have to specify the
after-castling location or drag the king and rook to those after-castling
location.
