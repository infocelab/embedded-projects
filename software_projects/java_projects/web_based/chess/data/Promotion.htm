<br>1. When the pawn is move to the last row of the opposite side, it becomes
eligible for promotion. The player must make a promotion now. Let Player1
make this movee with a white pawn. He moves the white pawn to the last row.
Now Player1 gets chance to make another move. He has to replace the pawn
with any of the Queen,Knight,Bishop immediately after this move. Player
1 cannot move any other piece except the now moved Pawn. Also the Player
2 cannot make any move until Player1 makes the promotion. Player 1 must
drag the eligible Pawn (not just any Pawn) onto any of the desired piece
placed in the left/right side of Chess Board and drop it. Immediately the
desired piece replaces the Pawn.
<br>2. Now the move is complete and Player 2 gets the chance to make his
