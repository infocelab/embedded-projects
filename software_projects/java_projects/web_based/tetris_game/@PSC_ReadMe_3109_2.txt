Title: Tetris With AI
Description: This program will allow you to play a regular game of tetris on any platform with a Java VM, pretty sweet, no? Maybe it's not. Tetris is a quintessential programming project and every hack out there has written his own copy. The difference between those programs and this one is that my tetris game will play itself - it's got built-in, and potentially extensible, AI that will play tetris. For tetris buffs, it also has "Malice Mode" and "Happy Mode" that, when enabled, will either try to screw you up by giving you the worst possible blocks at the worst time, or will toss you a bone every now and then when you need it. Give it a whirl.
