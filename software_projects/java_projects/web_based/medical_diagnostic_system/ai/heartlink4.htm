<p>Now that you've decided to lose weight, what are you going to do about it?
</p>
<p>Go on a low-fat/no-fat diet for a few months? Go on a crash diet and get this 
over with as fast as possible? Try yet <i>another</i> diet that gets results for 
a few months before you return to wearing your &quot;fat&quot; clothes again? </p>
<p>Many health care experts agree that diets do <i>not</i> work. The key isn't 
&quot;I'm going on a diet to lose weight.&quot; Rather, it's: &quot;I'm going to change <i>how</i> 
I eat once and for all.&quot; </p>
<p>Stephen Sinatra, M.D., who deals with weight loss every day in his cardiology 
practice, is a huge proponent of altering your relationship with food—not for 
two weeks or several months—but forever! </p>
<p>Here's what he has to say about healthy weight loss:

<p><br>
<b><span class="primeColor">Q:</span> What does that mean exactly—altering your 
relationship with food?</b><br>
<b><span class="primeColor">A:</span></b> There's no question about it, but 
that weight loss requires a lifestyle switch Once you make the switch, you won't 
want to return to the typical American diet, which is made up primarily of 
unhealthy fat. The average person—once he detoxifies himself from white flour, 
additives, preservatives and sugary foods—is going to get immediate fatigue and 
won't feel good if he continues to eat these foods. The alarm will go off and 
he'll say: 'I've just eaten something that I wasn't used to.'&quot; <br>
<br>
<b><span class="primeColor">Q:</span> What type of weight-loss program do you 
recommend for your patients?</b><br>
<b><span class="primeColor">A:</span></b> The program I've developed over my 
many years as a cardiologist employs the right amount of fiber, protein, 
carbohydrates and healthy fats to help you lose—and maintain—a healthy weight. 
My goal, of course, is to ensure that you also stave off heart disease, which is 
a leading killer of men and women. Excess weight is among the many contributors 
to heart disease. <br>
<br>
<b><span class="primeColor">Q:</span> Is your weight-loss plan good for 
everyone, or mainly people who have or want to prevent heart disease?</b><br>
<b><span class="primeColor">A:</span></b> This plan is great for everyone who 
want to lose weight. But I want to stress that it's not a one-week or six-month 
plan. It's a lifestyle change that trains you to eat with awareness—for life.
<br>
<br>
<b><span class="primeColor">Q:</span> What does it involve?</b><br>
<b><span class="primeColor">A:</span></b> It involves the following: </p>
<li type="square"><b>A high-protein shake.</b> If you take the shake, which 
provides plenty of fiber, along with a glass of water, you'll feel full. And 
that's really the key with weight loss—satiety. It helps to increase the basic 
metabolic rate which enables calories to be burned more efficiently. The shake 
is great for diabetics, too, because it doesn't elicit a big insulin response.
</li>
<li type="square"><b>Organic trail mix.</b> It provides high fiber, protein and 
healthy fat. When eaten with two glasses of water, your stomach expands and you 
feel even fuller. The mix also has high antioxidant value. </li>
<li type="square"><b>A meal bar.</b> The bar has a 33-33-33 ratio of protein, 
fat and carbohydrates. It's a great meal replacement, as well as a great snack. 
So between the shake, the trail mix and the bar, you'll get about 20 grams of 
fiber, which will help to cleanse your gastrointestinal tract. </li>
<li type="square"><b>Fresh veggies.</b> In the evening, I encourage my patients 
to eat legumes (chick peas, for example) and salad, which will provide another 
10-15 grams of fiber. Fiber helps keep things moving through your bowel. </li>
<li type="square"><b>A daily meal.</b> I also encourage one good solid meal that 
is based upon the Mediterranean diet, which is a kind of modified vegetarian 
diet made up primarily of fish, lean meats and lots of fresh fruits and 
vegetables. </li>
<li type="square"><b>Plenty of water.</b> Eight 8-oz. glasses of water a day 
will help flush toxins through the body and keep your body hydrated.</li>
