<b>Definition</b></p>
<p>An aneurysm is the &quot;ballooning&quot; of an artery caused by the weakening of the 
arterial wall. Apart from occasional low back pain, an aneurysm in the abdominal 
aorta usually causes no symptoms. However, large aneurysms can burst without 
warning, causing internal bleeding and usually ending in death. Fortunately, 
aneurysms can be treated surgically before rupture occurs. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>DIAGNOSIS OF AN ANEURYSM</b></u><br>
Your doctor may first suspect that you have an aneurysm while conducting a 
routine physical examination or while you are hospitalized for another problem. 
To confirm the diagnosis, a complete physical exam and special tests are 
necessary. </p>
<p><br>
<b>History and Physical Exam </b><br>
Your doctor will ask whether you have low back pain or tenderness below the 
ribs. These symptoms are sometimes suggestive of an abdominal aneurysm. As part 
of an examination, your doctor will carefully feel your abdomen for signs of 
swelling or tenderness. X­rays may be ordered to rule out other causes of your 
symptoms. </p>
<p><br>
<b>Ultrasound </b><br>
Images of an aortic aneurysm can be obtained quickly and painlessly with 
ultrasound (or sonography). High­frequency sound waves are sent through the skin 
and the echoes form an image on a TV monitor. Most medium­to­large aneurysms can 
be seen. All you will feel is the technician sliding the probe over your 
stomach. </p>
<p><br>
<b>CT Scan </b><br>
Your tests may include a CT scan (computerized tomography). CT is like an x­ray, 
except that the images appear as a series of thin slices. When viewed together 
they provide a three­dimensional image. To make selected areas easier to see, 
you may be given a special dye to drink or by injection. You will not feel the 
scanner. </p>
<p><br>
<b>Arteriography </b><br>
Arteriography is occasionally used to take more detailed pictures of an 
aneurysm. A special x­ray visible dye is injected into the aorta above the area 
of the aneurysm. As dye is released, x­rays are taken, revealing both the size 
and location of the aneurysm. You may feel a slight burning sensation as the dye 
is released into the circulation. </p>
<p><br>
<b>SURGERY FOR AN ANEURYSM </b><br>
A large aneurysm in the abdomen is particularly dangerous, since it can burst at 
any time. The majority of large aneurysms rupture within one or two years. 
Surgery is necessary to correct the problem before rupture occurs. </p>
<p><br>
<b>Surgery </b><br>
Surgery to correct an aneurysm usually takes from two to three hours. During 
this time you will be under general anesthesia and won't feel anything. First, 
the surgeon locates and exposes the aneurysm. With the aorta clamped to prevent 
bleeding, the aneurysm is then opened. Next, a synthetic, Y­shaped graft is 
stitched to the aorta at one end and the two iliac arteries at the other. The 
graft carries blood to the legs. </p>
<p><br>
<b>After Surgery </b><br>
After surgery you may be in the ICU for 24­48 hours to enable close monitoring 
of your breathing and heart function. Initially, all fluids will be given 
through an intravenous (I.V.) line placed into a vein. As you recover, you will 
be encouraged to get out of bed and walk about. Your doctor will let you know 
when you can leave the hospital and resume your normal activities. </p>
