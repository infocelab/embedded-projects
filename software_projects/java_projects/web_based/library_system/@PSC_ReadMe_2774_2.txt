Hi all
I have seen, Many people saying this is not running. Follow these steps:
1.) Just open any ide create a new project
2.) Then add all the java files to that project 
3.) Compile the file named library.java
4.) execute it.
Now it should be working correctly.
I used JCreator 2 IDE.
<strong>If you want to see the executable file click the library system.jar file in the zip file</strong>
