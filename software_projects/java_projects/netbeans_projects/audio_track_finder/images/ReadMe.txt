About TrackFinder:
TrackFinder version 1.00.1


Purpose:
This program was created for individuals who own numerous unlabeled mixed cds and would love to have a means of locating tracks on the cd.


How To Use:
In order for this program to work there have to be some type of distinction between the cds. For instance we label our cds with a number(ie, CD 1, CD 2..). Although "CD 1" is the most recommended format it isn't the only choice. There are many different alternatives like labeling the cds by color and so on.

Of course the saved cd name will have to match the label. For example, if you save the cd as "CD 1" then you should label your cd #1 or so, otherwise the program will not benefit you.

The program automatically creates a directory at  
"c:\track finder"  for placement of the saved cds. By default, it also looks in this folder when opening a cd.

Compile and run trackfinder.java to run program.
