Description: This is a very addicting and tricky game; you must get the 
blue balls on the left and the yellow balls on the right just by using
up and down to control the center gap. This is a fully commented program
that uses JPanel, JFrame, and Graphics to set up the game and run it.
If you are interested in learning how the game works, or how to use brute
force to control a bouncing ball around the screen, this program will 
provide everything that you need, and the comments should be understandable.
Let me know if you have questions, by email, or by leaving feedback. Thanks!
