Title: AddTrack
Description: This program can be used to keep track of advertisements of a company. I developed this program to one of the Mobile Operators in Sri Lanka called Sri Lanka Mobitel. It can be used by intermediate programmers to understand how JDBC works in a program. The interface is swing based and layout is done nicely. If you like this code, please make sure you rate it. It would keep me coding.
