Title: Java Hangman
Description: Documented java applet which plays a game of hangman. Overall, the code is basic and hopefully easily understandable. There is a short animation if the user loses; the man's face fades from red to blue as he "runs out of air".
The applet is actually not meant for the web, rather to be run in windows, so there may be browser bugs.
