Title: Budget Controlling
Description: Budget Controlling is my first Java project that I created as my final examination in Java Programming subject at my campus.
This program is already complete because contains Master, Transaction, Report and also Users Management functions.
I use jcalendar-1.3.2.jar as my date picker and jxl.jar to read excel file.
Users also can change MySQL Server location, UserID and Password from initial.ini file
This simple program, but I hope you can learn a lot of things.
If you want to learn this program you need some tools such as :
- NetBeans 6.0.1/ JCreator or latest
- MySQL 4 or latest + MySQL Connector
- JasperReport / iReport 2.0.5
