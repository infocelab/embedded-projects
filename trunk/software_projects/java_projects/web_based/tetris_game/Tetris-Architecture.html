Tetris Architecture Overview</h1>

Nick Parlante, nick.parlante@cs.stanford.edu

<p>This is the architectural overview that describes the Tetris classes.

The tetris project lives at the Stanford CS Ed library as document #112

(<a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/112/">http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/112/</a>).

See the Readme for an introduction to the project and instructions for

running the program.

<p>These Tetris classes provide a framework for a few different Tetris

applications. For a fun little assignment, students can write their own

"brain" AI code (surprisingly easy), and then load it into the provided

JTetris GUI to see how it plays. For 2nd year CS undergraduates, we have

a fairly difficult assignment where they implement all the main tetris

classes. This makes a nice exercise in OOP decomposition -- dividing the

rather large Tetris problem into several non-trivial classes that cooperate

to solve the whole thing.

<p>The classes that make up Tetris are...

<ul>

<li>

Piece -- a single tetris piece</li>



<li>

Board -- the tetris board</li>



<li>

JPieceTest / JBoardTest -- tester classes for Piece and Board</li>



<li>

JTetris -- present the GUI for tetris in a window and do the animation</li>



<li>

LameBrain -- simple heuristic logic that knows how to play tetris</li>



<li>

JBrainTetris -- a subclass of JTetris that uses a brain to play the game

without a human player</li>

</ul>

As an additional feature, the tetris classes implement the logic for tetris

in a way that runs <b>quickly</b>. The speed is needed for the later "brain"

parts of the project.

<h2>

Piece</h2>

The Piece class defines a tetris piece in a particular rotation. Each piece

is defined by a number of blocks known as its "body". The body is represented

by the (x, y) coordinates of its blocks, with the origin in the lower-left

corner.

<br><img SRC="piece.gif" BORDER=0 height=92 width=102>

<br>So the body of this piece is defined by the (x, y) points :&nbsp; (0,

0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1).

<p>The Piece class and the Board class (below) both measure things in this

way -- block by block with the origin in the lower-left corner. As a design

decision, the Piece and Board classes do not know about pixels -- they

measure everything block by block. Or put another way, all the knowledge

of pixels is isolated in the JTetris class.

<p>Each piece responds to the messages like getWidth(), getHeight(), and

getBody() that allow the client to see the state of the piece. The getSkirt()

message returns an array that shows the lowest y value for each x value

across the piece ({0, 0, 1} for the piece above). The skirt makes it easier

to compute how a piece will come to land in the board. There are no messages

that change a piece -- it is "immutable". To allow the client to see the

various piece rotations that are available, the Piece class builds an array

of the standard tetris pieces internally -- available through the Piece.getPieces().

This array contains the first rotation of each of the standard pieces.

Starting with any piece, the nextRotation() message returns the "next"

piece object that represents the next counter-clockwise rotation. Enough

calls to nextRotation() gets the caller back to the original piece.

<h2>

Board</h2>

The Board class stores the 2-d state of the tetris board. The client uses

the place() message to add the blocks of a piece into the board. Once the

blocks are in the board, they are not connected to each other as a piece

any more; they are just 4 adjacent blocks that will eventually get separated

by row-clearing.

<ul>

<li>

place(piece, x, y) -- add a piece into the board with its lower-left corner

at the given (x, y)</li>



<li>

clearRows() -- compact the board downwards by clearing any filled rows</li>

</ul>

Board has many methods that allow the client to look at the Board state.

These all run in constant time -- makes things easy and fast for the client,

but harder for the board implementation...

<ul>

<li>

int getWidth() -- how many blocks wide is the board</li>



<li>

int getHeight() -- how many blocks high is the board</li>



<li>

int getRowWidth(y) -- the number of filled blocks in the given horizontal

row</li>



<li>

int getColumnHeight(x) -- the height the board is filled in the given column.

This is 1 + the y value of the highest filled block</li>



<li>

int getMaximumHeight() -- the max of the getColumnHeight() values</li>



<li>

int dropHeight(piece, x) -- the y value where the origin (lower left corner)

of the given piece would come to rest if the piece dropped straight down

at the given x</li>

</ul>



<h3>

Board Undo</h3>

The Board also supports a 1-deep undo() facility that allows the client

to undo the most recent placement and/or row clearing. The undo facility

is rather limited -- the client can do a single place() and a single clearRows(),

and then use undo() to return to the original state. Although simple, the

undo facility is fast. It turns out that the Brain (below) needs exactly

this facility of a simple but fast undo. Here's how undo works...

<ul>

<li>

We'll designate the&nbsp; state of the board as "committed"&nbsp; -- a

state that can be returned to.</li>



<li>

From a committed state, the client can do a place() operation that modifies

the board. An undo() will remove the change so the board is back at the

committed state.</li>



<li>

Then the client can do a clearRows() operation which further modifies the

board. An undo() will remove all the changes so the board is back at the

committed state.</li>



<li>

Finally, the client can do a commit() operation which marks the current

state as the new committed state. The previous committed state can no longer

be reached via undo().</li>

</ul>

A client can use the undo facility to animate a piece moving in the board

like this: place() piece with y=15, pause, undo(), place() with y=14, pause,

undo(), place() with y=13, ...

<h2>

JPieceTest, JBoardTest</h2>

These are simple test classes that exercise the Piece and Board respectively.

Tetris is complex enough that it's important to build and test the components

separately.

<h2>

JTetris</h2>

The JTetris class presents the GUI for a playable tetris game in a window.

It uses Piece and Board to do the real work. Usually, I have the students

write Piece and Board, but I provide JTetris.

<h2>

JBrainTetris</h2>

JBrainTetris is a subclass of JTetris that uses the LameBrain (below) or

another loaded brain to play tetris without a human player. JBrainTetris

can also implement an "adversary" feature. The adversary is a cruel yet

hilarious feature where the game figures out what the worst possible next

piece is (using the brain), and then gives that piece to the player.

<h2>

LameBrain</h2>

LameBrain includes heuristic logic that knows how to play the game of tetris.

The LameBrain algorithm is very simple -- it knows that height is bad and

creating holes is bad. Students can write their own brains. Here is the

code...

<p><tt>/*</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;A simple brain function.</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;Given a board, produce a number that rates</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;that board position -- larger numbers for worse boards.</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;This version just counts the height</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;and the number of "holes" in the board.</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;See Tetris-Overview.html for brain ideas.</tt>

<br><tt>*/</tt>

<br><tt>public double rateBoard(Board board) {</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;final int width = board.getWidth();</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;final int maxHeight = board.getMaxHeight();</tt>

<p><tt>&nbsp;int sumHeight = 0;</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;int holes = 0;</tt>

<p><tt>&nbsp;// Count the holes, and sum up the heights</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;for (int x=0; x&lt;width; x++) {</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; final int colHeight = board.getColumnHeight(x);</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; sumHeight += colHeight;</tt>

<p><tt>&nbsp; int y = colHeight - 2; // addr of first possible hole</tt>

<p><tt>&nbsp; while (y>=0) {</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp; (!board.getGrid(x,y)) {</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holes++;</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; y--;</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp; }</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;}</tt>

<p><tt>&nbsp;double avgHeight = ((double)sumHeight)/width;</tt>

<p><tt>&nbsp;// Add up the counts to make an overall score</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;// The weights, 8, 40, etc., are just made up numbers that

appear to work</tt>

<br><tt>&nbsp;return (8*maxHeight + 40*avgHeight + 1.25*holes);</tt>

<br><tt>}</tt>

<br>&nbsp;

<p>It's pretty easy to write better brain logic, and that alone can be

the basis of an assignment. Here's some suggestions for building a better

brain (or don't look at these if you want to puzzle it out yourself) ...

<ul>

<li>

Height is bad</li>



<li>

Holes are bad</li>



<li>

Stacking more blocks on top of holes is bad</li>



<li>

Holes that are horizontally adjacent to other holes are not quite as bad</li>



<li>

Holes that are vertically aligned with other holes are not quite as bad</li>



<li>

Tall 1-wide troughs are bad</li>



<li>

1-wide troughs are not so bad if they are only 1 or 2 deep. Think about

which pieces could fill a 2-deep trough -- 1, 2, or 3 out of the 7 pieces

depending on the two sides of the trough.</li>



<li>

Concentrate on issues that are near the current top of the pile. Holes

that 10 levels below the top edge are not as important as holes that are

immediately below the top edge.</li>



<li>

At some point, my brain code always has some arbitrary constants like 1.54

and -0.76 in it that I can only lamely optimize by hand. To get the best

possible brain, use a separate genetic algorithm to optimize the constants.

This is another reason why the design here has such an emphasis on speed

-- the genetic optimizer needs to be able to rip through millions of board

positions.</li>

</ul>
