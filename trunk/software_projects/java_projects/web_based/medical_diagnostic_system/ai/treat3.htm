<p>Prevention is the major priority and the preventative strategies need to 
                  start at an early age when lifestyle habits and healthy 
                  behaviors can be reinforced. The focus is on anti-smoking, a 
                  healthy diet and a physically active lifestyle. It is never 
                  too late to reduce the risk of CHD.</P>

<font color="#800000"><b>A.
                      Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) </b></font>
                      <p>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      Available data suggests that HRT may offer long term 
                      protection against CHD in Healthy women only. In older, 
                      poorly mobile women with significant CHD, the clotting 
                      effects of HRT may outweigh and long term benefits.</p>

                      <p>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      An elevated total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a major 
                      risk factor for CHD in women as well as men. Women respond 
                      well to lipid lowering strategies (which include a lower 
                      fat diet and regular moderate exercise). In fact, despite 
                      that fact that women generally have a poorer prognosis 
                      following a heart attack or in response to interventions 
                      such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), women 
                      appear to have a response to intensive lipid-lowering 
                      therapy which is as good as or better than that of men. 
C. Stopping Smoking

                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      Smoking has been shown to increase CHD 2-3 fold in women. 
                      There must be a greater effort to discourage young women 
                      from starting smoking and to encourage other women who do 
                      smoke to stop.</p>

                      A low fat, high fibre diet contributes to an overall 
                      improvement in blood cholesterol and blood glucose levels, 
                      and aids in weight loss, and the ability to sustain a 
                      regular exercise program. Dietary supplementation with 
                      folic acid, vitamin B12 and Vitamin B6, or with folate 
                      alone, can lower elevated levels of homocysteine (a 
                      suspected CHD risk factor). Excessive alcohol and sugar 
                      intake can contribute to elevated triglycerides, 
                      hypertension, and obesity. Hence moderation, and in some 
                      cases abstinence, is required.</p>

<p>Physical activity goals consist of:
                        </p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>Endurance activities 4 – 7 days a week. </b></font>
</p>
<p>These are continuous activities for your heart, lungs, and circulatory system 
and include walking, swimming, cycling, jogging, racquet sports and team sports.
</p>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>Flexibility exercises 4 – 7 days a week. </b></font>
</p>
<p>Gentle stretching, bending, and reaching activities to keep your muscles 
relaxed and joints mobile. </p>
<p><b><font color="#800000">Strength exercises 2 – 4 days a week.
                      </font></b></p>
<p>These are activities against resistance to strengthen 
                      muscles and bones and improve posture.
                      Stress Reduction
                      The lack of social support, depression, low socioeconomic 
                      status, and stress have all been linked with increased 
                      incidence of CHD. All of these factors have been 
                      associated with a low chance of adopting healthy lifestyle 
                      behaviors and poor adherence to medical car.
