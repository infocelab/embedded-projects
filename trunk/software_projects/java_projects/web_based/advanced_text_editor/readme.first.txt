J Swing Pad is a simple Text Editor developed using 100 % pure Java aimed at performing simple 
tasks as performed by a normal Text Editor such as Windows Notepad.

It has many advanced features offered by similar professional text editing packages like
 - Menu Bars for easy navigation
 - MS Word like floatable, draggable graphical toolbars
 - Offers Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete popup menus on the right click of mouse and on the Menu bar 
   and toolbar as well.
 - Facility to open/modify and save all files (in text mode)
 - Chooses 3 different background colors
 - Fully commented and easily understandable code
 - An "About" Splash screen ( as on right..)

The Internet is full of tutorials used for developing advanced text editors using languages such 
as Visual Basic. However, there are a very few resources for doing the same using Java.
My aim of writing this application was to learn the advanced features of Java Swing Package,
and to share this application with fellow developers learning Java.

Installation instructions:
Unzip all the files, and place them in a single folder using an unzipping utility such as WinZip.
After unzipping you may use the Java.exe file (shipped with JDK, inside /jdk1.2.1/bin folder) to 
run the accompanying JSwingPad.class file
Eg: java JSwingPad

Optionally you may compile the source file (in case you modify something) using javac.exe file
(shipped with JDK, inside /jdk/bin folder)
Eg: javac JSwingPad.java

Please feel free to use, modify, distribute this application and its' code in any way you like, 
and if you find this useful, then Please VOTE for me in the PLANET SOURCE CODE 's contest.

Thanks in advance,
