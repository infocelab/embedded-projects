This is a two-player chess Game . Well, obviously chess is played by 2 players..so why am I saying it? coz don't expect this to be a Compuer Vs Human Chess. I admit I am not intelligent enough nor I have the time and energy to make a Computer Vs Human chess board. 
In CheckMate two human players can play the Chess in the same computer or over an intranet. Changes and moves made by one will be reflected in the other player's computer. 
Featues:
