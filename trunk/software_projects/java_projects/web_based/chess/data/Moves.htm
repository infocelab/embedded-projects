There are two <a href="../../../GameModes.htm">Modes</a> to play Checkmate.
<br>In both mode
<ul>
<li>
Move is made by <b>dragging the piece</b> from its cell/block to the desired
block <b>with the mouse</b>. Click the mouse on the piece and&nbsp; drag
the mouse (keeping the left mouse button down) and relase the mouse button
when the mouse is dragged to the destination block. If the move is valid
the piece is moved. Any existing peice in the destination cell is killed
(removed). If move is invalid, a message will be displayed in the Move
Status label.</li>

<li>
When there is a check, a message is displayed warning the player about
the check. The checked player must get out of check to continue playing.
He cannot make any move that does not nullify the check.</li>

<li>
The color in the Move Status label and a message will indictae whose move
it is currently (blasck or white). Only move for that color is allowed.</li>

<li>
When a move is complete, the color switches i.e. the other player is allowed
to make his move.</li>
</ul>
