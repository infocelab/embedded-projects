Title: Simple MVC Calculator
Description: This is a simple example of a calculator that uses the concept of MVC. View and 
process are placed in separate classes. It's just that I did not put the controller 
because I think is not necessary. This project was made with NetBeans IDE, so you can easily 
modify this code.
