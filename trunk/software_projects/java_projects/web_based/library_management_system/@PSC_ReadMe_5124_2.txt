Title: Library Management System
Description: This project is just a remake of one of the avalibale projects in this section name "Library System" by Muhammad Wasif. The GUI designed by him is excellent and received many applauds.However the implementation and testcases are not satisfactory as he rightly mentioned in his readme.txt file. I used his GUI but implemented the database with my own tables and database desgin. I feel that his GUI and my design of dataflow in the application makes it a almost ready to use application.I too used MSACCESS database at the backend.
Readthe readme.txt file in the zip folder.
