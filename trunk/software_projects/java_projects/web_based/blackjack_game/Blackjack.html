WELCOME TO BLACKJACK ONLINE<br><br>
Note: This is just a quick and dirty to explain a few things about the game;-<br>
A. In the event of a tie the bet is pushed.
<br>
B. In the event of the player going bust the dealer takes the bet.
<br>
C. Blackjack pays 2:1 and blackjack with a black jack pays 5:1.
<br>
D. Insurance pays 3:2 and is rounded down.
<hr>
The set of cards to go with the game are also here, you will need to have the 
images in a seperate folder though in the same place as the html and the class file.
